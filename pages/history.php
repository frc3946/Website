<p>
Tiger Robotics (FIRST Team 3946) began in 2011 through the efforts of Slidell High School teacher Jesse Hobson and student founder Gustave Michel, hoping to encourage awareness and participation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).
</p><p>
By the end of the 2011-2012 school year, the team grew to about twenty-five students with several parents acting as mentors. Many of these students had little or no experience designing, building, or testing robots; some had never before used power tools. Nevertheless, the team designed and built T1G3R, a robot which competed in the 2012 Bayou Regional FIRST Robotics Tournament and finished twenty-six out of fifty-one teams. The team built a compressed-air powered T-shirt cannon, which they demonstrated at a Slidell High football game. The team also mentored the FIRST Lego League (FLL) team at Slidell Junior High, refereed at regional and state FLL tournaments, and helped at the FLL Fast-Start event in Destrehan.
</p><p>
From the beginning, the FIRST ideals of gracious professionalism and coopertition have been vital to the team. We have often lent tools and time to assist other teams in need and graciously accepted help when we needed it. Also, just for fun, we played a friendly game of paintball against our cross-town rivals Northshore High School's Team Combustion.
